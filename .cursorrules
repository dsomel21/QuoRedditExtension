Quo Support Insights – Chrome Extension MVP
Purpose

Create a Chrome Extension that lets Quo employees easily collect Reddit posts or comments from the Quo support subreddit. The goal is to quickly capture and review real user pain points without manual copy-pasting or spreadsheets.

1. Overview

When a user visits the Quo subreddit (e.g. reddit.com/r/QuoSupport), they can click the Chrome Extension icon to open a sleek, modern interface (matching Quo/OpenPhone’s design language). From there, they can:

Save a Reddit post/comment link to an in-memory CSV list.

Download or copy all collected links in .csv format.

No backend or database will be used. Data persists only for the current browser session.

2. Goals

Primary Goal: Capture support insights quickly from Reddit.

Secondary Goal: Provide a beautiful, minimal UX consistent with Quo’s design aesthetic.

3. MVP Functionality
